# Wishy 
Wishy is a web app designed to help you create and share your wishlist with your partner, so you both always know what the other truly wants.

## Live app
Unfortunately, I do not make enough money to purchase a domain for each of my projects :( 

For now, the app is available at [wishy.aandrku.dev](wishy.aandkru.dev).
